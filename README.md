## Why [Soft-Eng-Practicum]?

- **Community:** Faculty, alumni, and students all come together to create
bespoke software solutions to tackle challenging, nuanced problems. By making
their academic work visible, we aim to inspire future students, encourage
interdisciplinary learning, and demonstrate the diversity of thought within
our programs.

- **Experience:** Students complete these projects in a simulated workplace
environment that mirrors professional software development. Through this
experience, they gain hands-on exposure to tools like Git and GitHub, modern
frontend frameworks such as React and Angular, cloud platforms like Firebase,
and agile collaboration practices used in industry today.

- **Showcase:** This site highlights our students' successes across many courses and
semesters, offering a public platform to celebrate their creativity,
technical achievement, and teamwork.
