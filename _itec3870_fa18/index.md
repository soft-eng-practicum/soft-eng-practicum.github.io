These projects were developed by [Georgia Gwinnett College][ggc]
students during the ITEC 3870 Software Development 2 course sections
taught by [Dr. Anca Doloc-Mihu][doloc-ggc]
and [Dr. Cengiz Gunay][gunay-ggc] in the Fall 2018 semester. Each
project was commissioned and supervised by a GGC professor or an
external client who provided the idea, requirements, and direction
throughout the semester. Final products were demonstrated and tested
by other students and faculty at the [GGC CREATE symposium][create] on
November 29th, 2018. Click on titles to see their demo sites.

Based on the votes of the guests testing the apps at the symposium,
here are the winning teams:

1.    Free Radicals, with ChemGenApp 
2.    Tech Titans, with "GGC Intern App"
3.    MatchMakers, with "What are my Chances?"
