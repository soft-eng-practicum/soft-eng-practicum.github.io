These projects were developed by [Georgia Gwinnett College][ggc]
students during the ITEC 3870 Software Development 2 course sections
taught by [Dr. Cengiz Gunay][gunay-ggc] in the Spring 2019 semester. Each
project was commissioned and supervised by a GGC professor or an
external client who provided the idea, requirements, and direction
throughout the semester. Final products were demonstrated and tested
by other students and faculty at the GGC CREATE symposium on
April 25th, 2019. Click on titles to see their demo sites.

Based on the votes of the guests testing the apps at the symposium,
here are the winning teams:

1.    Three Magicians, with Claw Connect 
2.    D&D, with "TechOps inventory tracking app"
3.    Indellibles, with "Event Tracking System"
