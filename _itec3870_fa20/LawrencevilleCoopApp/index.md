description: "For our Software Dev II project, our group is developing a mobile application for the Lawrenceville Cooperative Ministry. They are a community food bank ministry that provides food for people and families in need. The application’s main purpose is to provide a way for the Coop’s customers to “Check-in” before they come to pick up their free food. It will allow the user to provide enough information to the Coop, like name, phone number, and food preferences. This will allow the Coop to get the care package ready before the customer gets on site. It will also provide information about the Coop values and mission, as well as information regarding volunteering. Additionally, the app will provide information to allow people to contact the Coop and get directions to get to the facility."
