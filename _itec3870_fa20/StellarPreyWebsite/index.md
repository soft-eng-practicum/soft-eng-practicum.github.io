description: "Team A2J is working on creating a website for Stellar Prey, an in-development game that needs a site in order to be functional. This includes the ability for players to create an account and log in to the game as well as establishing a meeting place online for people to create and join communities, servers, and clans. The site will also display statistics of players and communities alike, keeping everyone up-to-date on who is doing the best and spending the most time in-game. This site can help people join the game and connect to other players, acting as a community-driven setting for cooperation among users."
