description: "For our Software Development II project, our team is taking over the existing STaRS Judging App utilized during the STaRS event showcasing student research in the STEM fields. The goals for this latest release are to provide both administrative and user functionality to the web application and to improve real-time updates between judge submissions. Judges should be able to log in to the web app, be able to view their assigned projects for evaluation, and submit their reviews. With each submission, the data should be uploaded for later review and manipulation by the administrator. The administrator should be able to log in with distinct authorization to view all judgesâ€™ evaluations and pull the results for presentation at the conclusion of the STaRS event."
