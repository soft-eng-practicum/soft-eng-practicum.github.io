description: "As part of our Software Development 2 course with Dr. Anca Doloc Mihu, we're required to create a website with for the Data Science and Analytics (DSA) program students. The website will consist of a login page, user profiles, information about DSA majors, and some kind of discussion board. This website will be accessible by users, Admin, DSA committee, and students. There will be a hierarchy of user authenticity. That is the features accessible by a systems admin will not be available to a DSA committee member or students in the DSA program."
