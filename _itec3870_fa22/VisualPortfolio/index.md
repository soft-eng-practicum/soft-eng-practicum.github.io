description: "Visual Portfolio is a web application designed to streamline the portfolio-making process. It is a visually interactive tool that allows you to swiftly construct customizable resumes, CVs, etc. Users can create an account and fill out blocks of information that they can then reuse in any document they make. The user is able to build their document using the dynamic drag and drop functionality, allowing them to build multiple tailored documents. Once a resume is built, the user is able to export it in their preferred extension, and save it to their portfolio for editing in the future."
