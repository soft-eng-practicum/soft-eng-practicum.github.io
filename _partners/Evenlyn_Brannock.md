Dr. Evelyn Brannock is an assistant professor of information technology at Georgia Gwinnett College. Brannock’s primary interests include digital signal processing, with an emphasis on the discrete wavelet transform, data security, especially in the area of watermarking, bioinformatics, software engineering and model driven architecture (MDA).

Before obtaining her Ph.D. in computer science at Georgia State University, Brannock worked in the field of information technology for over two decades. Her career started with training and consulting for an object oriented COBOL application development toolset. Her last position was as an integration architect with expertise in Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Business Process Management (BPM). The bulk of her experience has been with the Fortune 500. She was also a founder, owner and president of MouseKids.

Brannock has published several papers and journal articles in the fields of digital image processing, watermarking, and bioinformatics. She has been invited to give presentations about model driven architectures (MDA). Brannock’s teaching philosophy is best summarized by Plutarch: “The mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be ignited.”
