Walking Trails is an initiative formed at our college, Georgia
Gwinnett College, in partnership with the Gwinnett Parks and
Recreation Department. It aims to provide web-based access to area
trails and wellness instructions via videos. Our interns have
completed the first draft of this portal, and we plan to start testing
with strakeholders in September 2025 to collect feedback.
