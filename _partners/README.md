# The `_partners` Collection ü§ù

This directory stores individual partner profile pages used across the website
for attribution, recognition, and linking to project contributions.

All non-student participants of a project
(faculty advisor, non-profit organization, etc.) should be added to this
collection.

Each partner is represented by a single Markdown file containing YAML front
matter and optional content.

---

## Structure üìÅ

1. Each file should be named using the format `FirstName_LastName.md` or `Organization_Name.md`.
2. There should be no sub-directories.
