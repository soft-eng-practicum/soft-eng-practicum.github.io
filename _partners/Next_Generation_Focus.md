Next Generation Focus (NGF) is a 2022 top-rated nonprofit
organization with the mission to equip next generation leaders by
providing educational, relational, and financial resources. This
organization is fully committed to helping children thrive and
supporting the entire family and community. They operate in
Gwinnett County and therefore always serve a large number of
Hispanic citizens from low income populations. Our interns are
developing software to improve their organization’s internal
workflow. The software is digitizing their record keeping, which is
currently done on paper, and improve communications with parents,
staff, and administrators. In our first reporting year, we added the
staff section, improved many shortcomings in the existing family
section, and added an administrative control section that allows
adding schooling programs and send notififications to families and
stafff. We are closely working with NGF to have the product start a
beta test period soon, while we continue fifixing problems and
adding new requested features.
