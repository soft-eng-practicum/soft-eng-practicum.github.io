Greater Gwinnett Reentry Alliance (GGRA) helps citizens leaving
the prison system and aims to reintegrate them into society. Our
interns developed an interactive resources map for helping
returning citizens. This product is now complete and has been
delivered to the organization to start a testing phase so that we can
correct any remaining issues.
