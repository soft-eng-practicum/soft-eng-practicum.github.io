Satisfeed is a nonprofit that is focused on ending food insecurity in Gwinnett
County, which has a large Hispanic population. With 47,000 kids who worry
about food in Gwinnett, over half of them receive free or reduced meals during
the school year. Satisfeed organizes volunteer events to provide food to them
outside of school terms. Our interns are developing software to help with data
analytics. The app will help Satisfeed target their services to those
who need them most. In our grant’s first reporting year, our intern,
Nhu Thanh Tran, has completed an initial version of the web portal
that can parse Satisfeed’s existing data stores and produce an
interactive analytics dashboard. The portal is already deployed and we
aim to deliver the product for testing in Fall 2025, so that we can continue
improving it in later internship periods.
