### A Warm Welcome
<hr>

Early in the morning, our students—accompanied by faculty chaperones—arrived at Microsoft’s vibrant downtown **Atlanta** campus. Friendly staff greeted everyone at the front desk, provided visitor badges, and ushered the group into a spacious common area. There they met their guide for the day, a Microsoft employee and *proud alumna of our [GGC](https://ggc.edu)*!

### Insights from a Software Engineer
<hr>

Students were soon lead to a grand conference room where they were joined by a Microsoft software engineer. He generously described his day‑to‑day work and spent over an hour answering thoughtful student questions. His insights into project life cycles, team collaboration, and personal career growth left an inspiring and lasting impression.

### Touring Ten Floors and Two Buildings
<hr>

Next came a guided tour that spanned **ten floors across two buildings**. Students saw firsthand how Microsoft prioritizes accessibility and flexibility:

- Each floor features distinct architectural themes—colors, patterns, and textures that let employees choose the environment that best suits their needs.
- Microsoft is committed to accommodating the sensory preferences of every employee and encouraging creativity by allowing them to work freely among all of the various floors and office spaces.

### Work Hard, Play Hard!
<hr>

Beyond workspaces, the campus offers remarkable amenities:

- A locally renowned **restaurant and bar**
- A **fully-equipped recording studio**
- A **makers' studio** for hands-on innovation

These facilities showcased Microsoft’s commitment to employee well‑being and creative exploration.

### Lunchtime
<hr>

The tour concluded with lunch in the main building’s cafeteria. From vegan entrées to classic comfort food, the **diverse menu** delighted everyone. Smiling dining staff and delicious cuisine made for a perfect finale to the visit.

### Looking Ahead

We are deeply grateful for the *red‑carpet treatment* Microsoft extended to our community. This experience inspired our students and sparked ideas for future collaboration. **Thank you, Microsoft Atlanta!** We look forward to building on this outstanding partnership.
