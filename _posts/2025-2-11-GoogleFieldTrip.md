On February 11th, 2025, a group of our university students had the opportunity to
visit Google's regional campus in Atlanta, GA. The visit offered an in-depth
look at Google's workplace culture, technical infrastructure, and career
pathways available to aspiring tech professionals.

Students were greeted by members of Google's outreach and engineering
teams. The visit began with a welcoming session where Google employees discussed
the company's values, work environment, and commitment to innovation.

The day continued with a series of interactive presentations and demos focused
on:

- Software engineering workflows at Google
- Emerging technologies and cloud solutions
- Team structures and project life cycles

Our Grizzlies also toured various collaborative workspaces within the office,
learning how Google's design fosters creativity, inclusion, and productivity.

A panel discussion featuring current Googlers—ranging from software engineers
to UX designers—allowed students to ask questions about internships,
entry-level roles, and the transition from school to full-time work.

Many attendees commented on how the visit demystified the inner workings of one
of the world’s largest tech companies. For students interested in careers in
technology, the experience provided both practical insights and lasting
inspiration.

We are grateful to the team at Google Atlanta for their hospitality and for
