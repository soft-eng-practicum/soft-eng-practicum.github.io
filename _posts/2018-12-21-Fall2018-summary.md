As we close the fall semester, we published
the [demo page for the CREATE symposium](/itec3870_fa18/). This
semester we had two sections of the Soft Dev 2 course, one taught by
new IT faculty
[Dr Anca Doloc-Mihu](http://www.ggc.edu/about-ggc/directory/anca-doloc-mihu). We
welcome her to contributing to our organization.

Notable projects this semester were a new iteration of
the [GGC Maps](/itec3870_fa18/#GGC+Maps) project. Note that we now
have a [dedicated page on the GGC Maps project](/featured/ggc-maps) in
our new ["Featured Projects" section](/featured/), telling the history
and developments of this project.

Another notable project was the second iteration of
the [VSEPR Venture](/itec3870_fa18/#VSEPR+Venture) chemistry game. The
client for this project was our long-term
collaborator
[Dr Thomas Gluick](http://www.ggc.edu/about-ggc/directory/thomas-gluick),
who supervised another project this
semester: [ChemGenApp](/itec3870_fa18/#ChemGenApp).

We had a new external client, Brian Palm, who supervised two competing
teams trying to build a Physician's Assistant School matching
application called "What are my chances?".

Another external client, Josue Rodrigues, supervised a project on a
mobile app, [IDGMobile](/itec3870_fa18/#IDGMobile), for a local church in Gwinnett.

Finally, I want to acknowledge the work of fresh
graduate
[Nilaja Williams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nilajawilliams/) in
adopting the new look of our organization site!
