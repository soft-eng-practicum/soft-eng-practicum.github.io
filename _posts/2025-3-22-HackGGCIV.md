From electrifying workshops to powerful community-driven innovation, this year's campus hackathon was one for the books. With a theme inspired by the upcoming FIFA World Cup and a unique partnership with the campus Hispanic Outreach Club, the event brought together students, faculty, alumni, and a shared vision of tech for impact.

<br>
### 🎯 *A Hackathon with Purpose: Building for the Hispanic Community!*
<hr>

This year’s twist wasn’t just thematic—it was deeply purposeful. Participants were challenged to build products that could make a meaningful difference in the lives of the local Hispanic community. The response was inspiring. From accessibility tools to creative communication platforms, teams pushed their limits with empathy and innovation at the forefront.

The hackathon was made even more special through a vibrant collaboration between the hosting tech club and the Hispanic Outreach Club. This cross-club initiative brought diverse voices to the table and elevated the event's social mission.

### 🧠 *Workshops That Inspired, Talks That Transformed*
<hr>

Throughout the weekend, the hackathon played host to an enriching lineup of technical sessions:
- **Post-Quantum Encryption, Demystified**<br>
  A riveting keynote by a faculty expert introduced participants to the world of post-quantum cryptography, helping them grasp what’s next for cybersecurity in a quantum age.

- **Unity, React, and so much more!**<br>
  Attendees dove deep into practical skills with sessions on game development in Unity and modern web apps using React—perfect tools for building both playful and purposeful projects.

<br>
### 🎓 *Reconnecting with Alumni: A Heartfelt Highlight*
<hr>

Perhaps the most moving part of this year's hackathon wasn’t on a screen or in a code editor—it was in the faces and stories of those who came back to where it all began.

For our club, this hackathon wasn’t just another annual event—it was a full-circle moment. What started years ago as a humble, few-hour gathering in a cramped room in Building A has now blossomed into a vibrant, multi-day celebration of innovation spanning multiple rooms in Building C, including two stunning amphitheatre-style classrooms generously provided by the school. The transformation was surreal—and deeply emotional.

Seeing our alumni return to these expanded halls, now as mentors, judges, and champions of the next generation, reminded us of the vision that has guided this club from the beginning. There were hugs, there were laughs, and yes—there were even a few tears. Stories were swapped about late-night debugging marathons, early struggles to secure space and resources, and the quiet determination that laid the foundation for everything this event has become.

This moment of reconnection underscored something powerful: we are part of a living legacy. Our alumni didn’t just build cool projects—they built the club itself. And watching them witness how far it's come was a testament to how grassroots passion can grow into something truly enduring.
