GGC ITEC 4860 Software Development Project course is our students'
final capstone course for the Software Development concentration. Here
are some notable projects from this semester:

1. [**Anubis**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.natbanz.anubis) by _Nathaniel Bannis_ (source for [frontend](https://github.com/nateBanz/Anubis-Companion) and [backend](https://github.com/nateBanz/anubisbackend)). Anubis leverages the power of machine learning to help users develop their Overwatch skillset and rank up in role queue! _This App requires you to have done role queue placements for all three roles, Damage, Tank and Support._ Anubis creates a new ranking for you purely based upon your mechanical skills and shows you the difference between the two. Anubis also gives you the option to see how your skills compare the collective group of Overwatch players and can give you advice on how to improve these metrics!
1. [**Twish**](https://twish-2dd01.web.app/login) by _Keyvan Shabani, Joshua “Mart” Miller_ (source for [frontend](https://github.com/keyvan1996/twish) and [backend](https://github.com/Merchant151/TwishBackend)). A study conducted by OnePoll, in conjunction with Evite, looked into the birthday celebration habits of 2,000 Americans and found that as many as 35 percent of people have had their significant other forget their birthday. This is where Twish comes into play, a user-friendly website that allows users to send automated celebratory wishes to their friends and family. It allows the users to add their custom message, the date that the message must be sent, and more information. Users are able to add as many celebratory messages as they want. After creating the celebratory messages, users are able to update and delete all the information they provided.
1. [**VirtualTats**](https://github.com/amathews4/HenTats/releases/tag/release) by _Ayesha Syeda, Mohfez Rahman, Austin Mathews_. <br> We are looking to make an app that utilizes AR to showcase what it would be like to have Henna or tattoos on one’s skin. Tattoos are a permanent decision, and henna is a temporary yet important decision, especially on an auspicious occasion. This app would allow the user to “try on” a tattoo/ henna before deciding on it. To answer the question of why is this unique? Well, there are apps out there that allow for AR tattoos, but there aren’t any apps that focus on Henna tattoos too. We are trying to blend in culture and fashion.
1. [**Carpare**](https://kkim9.github.io/Carpare/) by _anonymous_ ([source](https://github.com/kkim9/Carpare)). Car comparison website. Target audience is car enthusiasts, therefore the specifications listed on this website are/would be important for enthusiasts rather than other demographics that might want to look for information about trunk space or colors offered. A website that presents a clean way to compare up to 5 cars without having to open multiple tabs to look through different cars and find their specifications.
1. [**Fluke**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JJ_weTBzita_e62jBSZ9N_S3Am4XE2E1/view?usp=sharing) by _Fabio Valenzuela and another student_ ([source](https://github.com/fabiovalenzuela/fluke)). Fluke has become an app design to connect individuals who have limited to no Internet access in the area. It uses Wi-Fi direct that is built-in to most android devices in order to communicate via a medium length range.
1. [**Big Stomach**](http://ezekieltoby.altervista.org/tyz.php) by _Ezekiel, Tyree_ is an app that contains food recipes ([source](https://github.com/TyreeKing/BigStomachAS)). Users can add their recipe and view recipes both in categories or all at once.
