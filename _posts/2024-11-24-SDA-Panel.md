On November 14, 2024, the halls of the School of Science and Technology echoed not just with lines of code and frustrated chemists, but with wisdom, laughter, and inspiring career stories! Our club proudly hosted the Software Development Alumni Career Panel—an evening dedicated to bridging the gap between current students and those who once walked the same hallways, laptops in tow and ambition in hand.

This wasn’t just another career night. It was a celebration of community, growth, and the shared journey of becoming a developer in today’s ever-evolving tech world.

### 🍽 A Night of Connection: Dinner, Networking, and Community

The evening kicked off with a warm, catered dinner that brought students and alumni together over shared plates and shared passions. Conversations buzzed with everything from React tips to “first job” war stories.

Afterward, we transitioned into speed networking, where students had the chance to rotate among alumni in timed bursts—swapping questions, contact info, and plenty of laughs. This format allowed attendees to make personal connections in a fast-paced but welcoming setting.

Before the panel officially began, we were honored with a few words from the Dean of the School of Science and Technology, whose reflections on alumni success and the importance of mentorship set the tone for the evening. The message was clear: the student experience doesn’t end at graduation—it evolves into legacy.

### 🎤 The Panel: Wisdom from Those Who've Been There

Then came the main event: a panel of accomplished software development alumni, seated before a packed room of eager students. These professionals represented a spectrum of experience—from those fresh into their careers at startups, to seasoned engineers thriving in Fortune 500 companies.

**What did they share?** Everything.
- Realistic takes on the transition from college to the industry
- How to navigate imposter syndrome in your first tech job
- Building portfolios that get you noticed
- The value of personal projects, open source, and continued learning
- Tips for networking, interviewing, and growing into or out of your role

What made the conversation especially powerful was its honesty. The alumni didn’t shy away from discussing their failures and missteps—turning them into teachable moments for students hungry for guidance.

### 🧑‍🎓 A Full-Circle Moment (and a Fun Surprise!)
<hr>

One especially heartwarming—and hilarious—highlight of the night came when one alumna, now a technical account manager at a major firm, casually revealed something unforgettable: back when she was a student, she was assigned to work on this very website! (You can see here handiwork [here](/itec3870_sp23/SD2Website))

That's right—the same site you’re reading this on now!

Her story had the entire room smiling. It was a lighthearted reminder that every student project, no matter how small it seems at the time, can lead to something much bigger. Full-circle moments like these don’t just make great anecdotes—they make great memories.

### 💬 Final Reflections: Legacy in Action
<hr>

The Software Development Alumni Career Panel was more than just an event—it was a vivid snapshot of what this club and this college can offer: a lifelong community of learners, builders, and mentors.

As the room slowly emptied and business cards were pocketed, one thing was clear: students left not only with advice, but with new visions of what their futures in tech could look like.

And if we're lucky, some of those same students will be back one day—panelist mics in hand, stories to share, and maybe even a few inside jokes about being assigned to update the club’s website.

We’re already looking forward to next year. 🚀

Until next time, happy coding!
