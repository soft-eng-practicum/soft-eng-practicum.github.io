Our students were recently appeared in the news, thanks to an app they
developed for a local non-profit organization, Greater Gwinnett Re-entry Alliance (GGRA). The article was
published on the GGC News and Events page under the
title
["Citizensâ€™ re-entry into society made easier thanks to Georgia Gwinnett College students"](https://www.ggc.edu/about-ggc/news/News/citizens-re-entry-into-society-made-easier-thanks-to-georgia-gwinnett-college-students). The story was also published in the [June 2020 issue of the GGRA Newsletter](https://www.gwinnettreentry.org/?page=CiviCRM&q=civicrm%2Fmailing%2Fview&reset=1&id=65).
More information about the app, which was developed by students in the ITEC 3870 course of the
Spring 2020 semester, can be found at
