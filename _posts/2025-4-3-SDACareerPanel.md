On April 3rd, 2025, [GGC](https://ggc.edu) hosted another inspiring installment
of our ongoing Software Development Alumni Career Panel, bringing together
current students and accomplished alumni for a day focused on mentorship,
career development, and networking.

The event featured alumni from a range of industries and expertises. These
professionals volunteered their time to meet with students in both small and
large-group settings, providing firsthand insights into their fields and the
diverse pathways that led them to success.

- Breakout sessions focused on resume writing, interview skills, and career pivots
- Informal networking over dinner with visiting alumni and faculty

The event was opened by
[Dr. Joseph Ametepe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-ametepe-5ab30794),
Dean of [GGC's School of Science and Technology](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/ggc-school-of-science-and-technology/),
to whom we are thankful for his continuing support, and it was followed by a
very engaging Q&A panel session and a speed networking event.

Students praised the event for its candid conversations and actionable advice.
Many noted that connecting with alumni who once walked the same campus halls
gave them a clearer, more personal vision of their own professional futures.

These career conversations are invaluable in helping our students build
confidence and clarity as they prepare to launch their own careers.

We, once again, extend our heartfelt thanks to our extraordinary alumni who
spared their valuable time to give back to our current students:
