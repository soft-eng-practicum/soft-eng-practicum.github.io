### *Innovation, Collaboration, and Unforgettable Moments!*
<br>
<hr>

The dust has settled, the caffeine has _finally_ worn off, and the final projects have been showcased—but the excitement from HackGGC III, our third-ever (plus one prototype) hackathon at [GGC](https://ggc.edu), is still buzzing! As we prepare for HackGGC IV, why don't we reflect on this incredible event? Let's take a moment to celebrate the creativity, collaboration, and learning that defined our most successful hackathon to date...

<br>
#### 🎉 A Hackathon to Remember
<hr>

With over 40 students in attendance, last year’s hackathon was our 3rd annual event and brought together coders, designers, and problem-solvers of many concentrations. Both first-time hackers or seasoned competitors joined forces to build exciting projects, attend insightful workshops, and push their skills to the next level.

**From the opening ceremony to the final project presentations, HackGGC III was filled with energy, passion, and innovation.** Students worked tirelessly over 10 hours, brainstorming, coding, debugging, and collaborating—showcasing not just technical prowess, but teamwork, creativity, and resilience.

<br>
#### 🛠️ Workshops & Learning Experiences
<hr>

Some of the highlights of last year's hackathon was our lineup of workshops designed to equip attendees with new skills and fresh ideas. Some of the most engaging sessions included:

- :snake: **Introduction to Python** - hosted by our very own president, Celeste Nicols!
- :atom_symbol: **Introduction to React** - hosted by our very own faculty advisor, Dr. Cengiz Gunay!
- :trident: **Introduction to Git** - hosted by our former treasurer, Eric Choi!

These sessions provided participants with valuable knowledge they could apply directly to their hackathon projects—or take with them as inspiration for future endeavors. In fact, shortly after Dr. Gunay's Introduction to React seminar, I tried pitching the idea of rebuilding *this very website* using it! :joy:

#### 🏆 The Projects & Winners
<hr>

Last year's hackathon featured over 10 incredible projects, ranging from spooky games (in which our very own Dr. Doloc-Mihu was the antagonist :ghost:), to interactive web applications aimed at answering some of the deep-seated needs of our fellow Grizzlies. Some standout projects include:

- 🏅 Best Overall: `Study App - By: Connor and Sean`

Over the course of only a single day, Connor and Sean teamed up to make a fully-fledged, full-stack web app catering to the general needs of students. Using a combination of TypeScript, Java, and Firebase, users are equipped with a full suite of functionality to manage their time and stay on top of assignments.

**_Importantly_**, Sean and Connor recently won *Best Use of MongoDB Atlas* at UGA's [UGAHacks](https://ugahacks.com)!


- 🏅 Best Solo: `Task Manager - By: Joel`

- 🏅 Best Beginner: `Gor-Mail - By: Isaiah`

Of course, a huge thank you to Georgia Gwinnett College for allowing us this opportunity and investing in the next generation of innovators!

We also want to recognize our mentors and judges who dedicated their time and expertise to guiding participants and ensuring the event ran smoothly. Your contributions were invaluable, and we truly appreciate your support. :heart:
