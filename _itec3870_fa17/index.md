These projects were developed during the ITEC 3870 Software
Development 2 course taught by [Dr. Cengiz Gunay][gunay-ggc] in the
Fall 2017 semester by [Georgia Gwinnett College][ggc] students. Each
project was commissioned and supervised by a GGC professor who
provided the idea, requirements, and direction throughout the
semester. Final products were demonstrated and tested by other
students and faculty at the GGC CREATE symposium. Click on
