I'm a senior Software Development major passionate about developing data-driven applications that support organizational decision-making and operational efficiency. I specialize in transforming raw datasets into structured, actionable insights through clean visualizations and intuitive user interfaces.

## My Role in the Project

The Satisfeed Internal Dashboard is a web-based analytics tool that visualizes donation and assistance data to support operational planning for a food distribution nonprofit. It helps staff and stakeholders understand trends in need, donation patterns, and demographic distributions.

**Sponsor:** Satisfeed NPO and Georgia Gwinnett College (via NFS Grant)  
**Team Size:** Solo  
**Duration:** Spring 2025  

As the sole developer, I designed and implemented the entire dashboard using React, Firebase, and Next.js as the backend framework. I collaborated with the sponsor to gather functional requirements and worked with the data science team to translate analytical needs into interactive visual components. I also engineered the data pipeline for cleaning and migrating historical datasets and implemented CSV upload and GeoJSON-based mapping capabilities to support real-time data visualization.

## Reflections

This internship gave me the opportunity to take ownership of a real-world project, from requirements gathering to deployment. I am proud of the trust the sponsor placed in me and how I was able to translate complex datasets into actionable insights. Solving merge conflicts and ensuring a smooth data upload experience were both challenging and rewarding. This experience helped me grow as both a developer and a collaborator, and I now feel more confident stepping into a full-time software engineering role.
