# The `_students` Collection üë©‚Äçüéì

This directory stores individual student profile pages used across the website for attribution, recognition, and linking to project contributions.

Each student is represented by a single Markdown file containing YAML front matter and optional content.

## Structure üìÅ

1. Each file should be named using the format `FirstName_LastName.md`.
2. There should be no sub-directories.
