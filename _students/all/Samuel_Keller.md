## My Roles
**Satisfeed GeoAnalytics Dashboard:**
Satisfeed is a MapLibre-powered analytics dashboard that turns distribution data and school / library location data into privacy-aware geographic insights for food-insecurity planning.

- **Sponsor:** Georgia Gwinnett College and Satisfeed
- **Team Size:** 3 people
- **Duration:** Fall 2025

I led the front-end architecture and UI/UX for Satisfeed, designing the dashboard’s information hierarchy, visual system, and interactive map experience. Along with my team, I built the Next.js + Tailwind + MapLibre front end, implemented layered map overlays and heatmaps, and helped shape a privacy-aware GeoJSON data flow so complex datasets could be explored clearly and safely in a real client-facing environment.

**AnalySim:**
Analysim is a free online web platform enabling researchers to analyze and share data by providing interactive visualizations, and collaborate with others. The open platform is specialized for working with high-dimensional data sets such as those constructed via computational modeling. Analysim also allows you to run custom analysis on any type of data.

- **Sponsor:** Georgia Gwinnett College 
- **Team Size:** Solo
- **Duration:** Spring 2026
  
As a front-end developer, I so far have focused on refactoring AnalySim's UI by introducing a token-based design system and global styles. Migrating pages into reusable, consistent patterns to improve maintainability and scalability.


## Skills Applied & Learned

- Front-end architecture and design systems (token-based theming, global styles)
- React / Next.js development
- SCSS architecture and scalable CSS
- Legacy UI refactoring and migration
- Interactive maps and geospatial data (MapLibre, GeoJSON)
- CSV data parsing and transformation
- Responsive UI/UX implementation
- Git, PRs, and version control
- Stakeholder communication on technical decisions
