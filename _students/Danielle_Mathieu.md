I'm a recent Computer Science graduate with a strong interest in AI and front-end technologies. I’m motivated by the challenge of creating innovative solutions that make everyday life easier for everyone of different backgrounds. Outside the classroom, I enjoy participating in volunteering at coding camps and tutoring new coders.

## My Role in the Project

**Sponsor:** Next Generation Focus  
**Team Size:** 2 students  
**Duration:** 3 months  

My role included updating the web-dashboard by making the project scalable and accessible for all levels of users. I was responsible for implementing the front-end in React and interacted with MongoDB to publish and post real-time updates.

## Skills Applied & Learned

- Full-stack development (React, Node.js)
- RESTful APIs & MongoDb integration
- Agile sprints & team communication

## Reflections

This project taught me to manage my time effectively and quickly adapt to an existing codebase. I learned how to think abstractly when solving problems and gained a better understanding of industry expectations. I'm proud of how my coding skills have developed while collaborating with our client. The experience helped me realize that I want a career that makes underrepresented communities lives easier through tech.
