> I'm a Spring 2025 graduate with a passion for building impactful, inclusive technology that addresses real-world challenges. Outside of technology related hobbies I enjoy hiking, playing tennis, swimming and traveling.

## My Role in the Project

**Sponsor:** [Next Generation Focus]  
**Team Size:** [Solo]  
**Duration:** [Spring 2025]

> As the Software Development Intern, I designed and optimized RESTful APIs, integrated third-party services and resolved full-stack bugs to improve user experience. I modernized a legacy JavaScript codebase, and managed Git workflows. I also implemented and deployed key features such as admin tools, program management, and password reset functionality.

## Skills Applied & Learned

- Full-stack development (React, Node.js)
- RESTful APIs & Brevo integration
- Team communication & git workflows

## Reflections

> This project taught me how to effectively incorporate client feedback to align the final product with their vision. It also highlighted areas of team communication I need to improve, providing valuable insight into my collaborative skills. Overall, it was an eye-opening experience that reaffirmed my interest in working with smaller companies where impact and communication are more direct.
