I'm a Software Development major at Georgia Gwinnett College, expected to graduate in December 2025. I’m passionate about building software that has a direct impact on people’s lives—whether that’s through interactive campus applications, AI-powered matchmakers, or real-time stock simulators. I bring technical experience to the table, having led award-winning software projects. I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments and enjoy working on products that blend creativity, logic, and user-centered design.

## My Role in the Project

As part of the Walking/Fitness Trails app initiative, I helped engineer a digital trail map system for GGC, complete with outlined walking paths, marker locations, and embedded instructional content. I refactored the app’s codebase for scalability and helped standardize development across multiple teams. I also led syncs with faculty advisors, ensuring the product aligned with client goals.

**Sponsor:** Georgia Gwinnett College – ITEC & EXSC Departments  
**Team Size:** 3 development teams  
**Duration:** 10 weeks – Spring 2025

## Skills Applied & Learned

- Full-stack development (React, Node.js, MongoDB)
- Frontend design using Bootstrap and responsive CSS
- RESTful API integration using Axios
- Code refactoring and team codebase standardization
- Agile collaboration with cross-functional teams

## Reflections

- This project taught me how to collaborate at scale, balancing multiple feedback loops and aligning code between teams.
- I’m proud of our success in integrating trail data and video interactivity to boost community wellness engagement.
- It confirmed my desire to work on impactful web applications and grow as a leader in cross-disciplinary environments.
