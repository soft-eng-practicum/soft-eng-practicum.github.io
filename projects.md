<h2>How It Works</h2>

<h4>Student-Driven Solutions for Non-Profits</h4>

<p>Our students are empowered to design and develop custom software solutions that meet the unique needs of non-profit organizations. These hands-on projects are integral to GGC’s curriculum, providing students with valuable experience while helping local non-profits achieve their goals.</p>

<ul>

    <li>
        <strong>Collaboration:</strong>
        Each project is a partnership between GGC students and a local non-profit.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Semester-Based:</strong>
        Projects are completed over the course of one semester, ensuring fresh, timely solutions.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Impactful Results:</strong>
        From data management systems to community outreach tools, our students’ work leads to real, actionable improvements for non-profits.
    </li>
