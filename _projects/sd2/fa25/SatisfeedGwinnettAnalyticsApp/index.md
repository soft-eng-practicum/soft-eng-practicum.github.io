Our team designed and developed an interactive web portal that transforms Satisfeed’s existing data into a clear, actionable analytics dashboard. We integrated distribution data and community resources into a unified map-based interface, giving Satisfeed real-time visibility into food-distribution needs across Gwinnett County. This project was a continuation of Satisfeed: Data Analytics App and developed by the team "Let 'Em Cook" in Fall 2025, consisting of Dylan Long, Ewura Ama Awere, and Sam Keller.
