The system is built with React for the frontend and Firebase for backend services. It allows:

- Students to sign up for quiz retakes and manage appointments
- Faculty to add quizzes, view sign-ups, and manage classes
- Admins to approve new faculty, manage proctor availability, and oversee retake schedules

The goal of the project is to streamline the quiz retake process with dynamic forms, real-time dashboard updates, and improved communication between students, faculty, and proctors.
