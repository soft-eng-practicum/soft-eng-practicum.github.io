Walking Trails is an initiative formed at Georgia Gwinnett College,
in partnership with the
[Gwinnett Parks and Recreation Department](https://www.gwinnettcounty.com/
departments/parksandrecreation).
It aims to provide web-based
access to area trails and wellness instructions via videos.  

We created the analytics dashboard, implemented likes/dislikes on videos,
and improved security on the backend for this website.
