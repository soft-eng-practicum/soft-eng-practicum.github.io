Walking Trails is an initiative formed at Georgia Gwinnett College,
in partnership with the
[Gwinnett Parks and Recreation Department](https://www.gwinnettcounty.com/
departments/parksandrecreation).
It aims to provide web-based
access to area trails and wellness instructions via videos.  

Our interns have completed the first prototype
of this portal for trails within our college campus, and we
plan to start testing with stakeholders in September 2025 to collect
feedback.
