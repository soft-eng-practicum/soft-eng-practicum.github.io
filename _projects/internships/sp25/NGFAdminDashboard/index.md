Our intern added the staff section, improved many shortcomings
in the existing family section, and added an administrative control
section that allows adding schooling programs and send notifications
to families and staff.  
We are closely working with NGF to have the product start
a beta test period soon, while we continue fixing problems and
adding new requested features.
