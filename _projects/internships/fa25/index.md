These projects were developed by [Georgia Gwinnett College][ggc]
students during the [National Science Foundation (NSF)][nsf]-supported
software development internship program supervised by [Dr. Cengiz
Gunay][gunay-ggc] and [Dr. Anca Doloc-Mihu][doloc-ggc] in the Spring
2025 semester. Each project was commissioned and supervised by a GGC
professor or an external client who provided the idea, requirements,
and direction throughout the semester.
