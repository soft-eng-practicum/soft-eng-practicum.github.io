These projects were developed by [Georgia Gwinnett College][ggc]
students during the ITEC internship course
taught by [Dr. Cengiz Gunay][gunay-ggc] in the Fall 2025
semester. Each project was commissioned and supervised by a GGC
professor or an external client who provided the idea, requirements,
and direction throughout the semester.
