description: "The software development website will have enhanced styling and usability by improving its appearance. In addition, the website will be updated to provide a better accounting of faculty, students, and technologies involved. Lists will be added that enable users to click and access more detailed information. For example, clicking on a student's name will display a list of all the projects they have worked on. These improvements will enhance the user experience and make the site more user-friendly."
