description: "Our latest development, SAUCE 2.0, has transformed the already impressive Raspberry Pi and Python-based project into a powerful Android Web application, which now boasts an easy-to-use mobile platform, complete with a well-designed dashboard and intuitive user interface. The application allows users to collect data from various sensors such as cameras, temperature, and humidity, and store it seamlessly in the cloud. Our innovative approach includes interactive sliders for data viewing, providing users with an unparalleled on-the-go experience. We have leveraged Flask and Dash packages to create a functional, intuitive dashboard that uses a pioneering machine learning algorithm to detect 'cracks' in images and tag high-probability images for easy analysis. The new mobile-tablet application is designed to provide new and exciting user interface experiences for the physics department and NASA projects. SAUCE 2.0 is the ideal solution for those seeking a modern, user-friendly approach to structural analysis."
