description: "The Grizzly Hacks student organization has been developing a web application that will act as a one-stop shop for any information regarding their activities or hackathons. Significant progress has been made on this by previous groups, but when passed off to the Hackers much of this needed to be brought in line with modern requirements. To accomplish this we were tasked with bringing technologies in line with the latest versions, improving administration over hackathon events, and introducing a new section that would allow Grizzly Hacks to inform members about other events that may occur throughout the semester. By doing this the Grizzly Hacks website will become an essential tool for anyone interested in the organization or any of the happenings surrounding them."
