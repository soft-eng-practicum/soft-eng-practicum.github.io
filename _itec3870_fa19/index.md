These projects were developed by [Georgia Gwinnett College][ggc]
students during the ITEC 3870 Software Development 2 course sections
taught by [Dr. Cengiz Gunay][gunay-ggc]
and [Dr. Anca Doloc-Mihu][doloc-ggc] in the Fall 2019 semester. Each
project was commissioned and supervised by a GGC professor or an
external client who provided the idea, requirements, and direction
throughout the semester. Final products were demonstrated and tested
by other students and faculty at the GGC CREATE symposium on Nov
21th, 2019. Click on titles to see their demo sites.

The apps were tested by participants at the symposium, who submitted
their scores for each app in the categories of *completeness*,
*usefulness*, and *appearance*. Scores were summed and combined to
find the following best teams and their products:

1.    STaRS Judging App by *Polaris*
2.    GGC Maps by *Vegan't*
3.    Shutter Plug by *ShadowFax*
